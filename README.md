# EVA Mobile Application and EV Charging Infrastructure

## EVA Mobile Application

EVA is a feature-rich mobile application designed to enhance the driving experience for electric vehicle (EV) owners. It provides predictive range estimation, seamless integration with various charging solution providers, and a user-friendly interface.

### Key Features:

## **Range Prediction Process:**
  - Utilizes factors such as battery State-of-Charge, driver behavior, weather, traffic, and vehicle specifications.
  - Predicts range in worst, average, and optimized scenarios, visually represented on a map for the driver.

 ## **Charging Station Integration:**
  - Connects with external charging station networks for Public Charging Stations.
  - Provides real-time location, availability, booking options, account management, usage statistics, and secure payment processing.

 ## **Design Aesthetics:**
  - Enhances the overall design aesthetic without compromises, offering a market-leading user experience.

## EV Charging Infrastructure

Inspired by successful foreign models, our EV charging infrastructure aims to bring smart, sustainable, and cost-effective solutions to the Indian market.

### Key Features:
## Ultra-Fast Connectivity:
- Utilizes ultra-fast fiber and 4G connectivity for a secure data network.
- Achieves wireless speeds up to 1Gb/s between home and vehicle.

## Smart IoT Sensors:
- Integrates IoT sensors for environmental data (air quality, temperature, parking occupancy).
- Enables a smart and responsive charging infrastructure.

## Manufacturing and Materials:
- Manufactured in the UK with an 80% recycled material composition.
- Armadillo/Gecko units made of recycled rubber for durability and waterproofing.

## Smart Charging Units:
- Offers smart charging units (3.5kW to 7kW) for versatile charging options.
- Grid management and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) readiness for evolving EV technologies.

## Robust Design and Maintenance:
- Designed for intensive use with easy repair and maintenance.
- 45-minute repair/replacement time for user-friendly maintenance.

## User Interface:
- User-friendly interface through a mobile app and RFID payment mechanisms.

## Plug Unit and Power/Data Pack:
- Armadillo/Gecko units (type 2 sockets) compatible with all UK car/van models.
- RFID readers for secure access.
- Below-ground power/data pack with outer shell acting as a foundation.

## Power and Data Pack:
- Contains a waterproof inner box with controller, fuses, 30mA RCD, and connectivity components.
- Node units connect 1 to 15 chargers, linked to a feeder pillar for power and telecommunications.


## **Sustainability:**
  - Manufactured from 80% recycled car tires, ensuring a low environmental impact.

## **Grid Management and Vehicle-to-Grid Readiness:**
  - Enables efficient grid management and supports vehicle-to-grid functionality.

## **Space Efficiency:**
  - Requires minimal installation space, optimizing design and infrastructure costs.

## Vehicle Interface System (VIS):
- To ensure seamless communication between EVA and the EV's on-board systems, a Vehicle Interface System (VIS) should be developed.

- **Integration:**
  - Connects with the EV's CAN bus, Bluetooth, GSM/GPRS, and GPS systems for comprehensive functionality.
  

## How to Use

### Mobile Application Integration:
- The mobile application developed will seamlessly connect to the software of the proposed EV charging infrastructure.
- Users have the option to create a unified experience by integrating with the existing software or developing a custom solution.
  
### Comprehensive Features:
- The application provides real-time integration with the charging infrastructure, offering location, availability, and booking options.
- Users can conveniently access, update account details, track usage statistics, balances, and securely manage payments within the system.
- The integrated solution is designed as a one-stop solution to address range anxiety among EV drivers.

### Range Prediction Process:
- The mobile application incorporates advanced algorithms for predicting the range of the EV.
- Factors such as battery State-of-Charge level, past driver behavior, weather conditions, traffic information, and vehicle specifications contribute to accurate predictions.
- The system calculates range based on worst, average, and optimized scenarios, displayed on a map for the driver's convenience.
